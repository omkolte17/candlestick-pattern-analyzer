## Additional Information
### What is Flask ?
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

### What is Technical Analysis Library ?
TA-Lib is an open-source python library that is used in analyzing the stock market's historical data like share price, volume, etc. in order to predict the future price or the market direction so that we can make our investments accordingly.

## Technical Scanner
The technical scanner will scan for the data of various stocks and provide all the stocks which has formed a particular pattern along with its candlestick chart like in the below image which shows the `Doji` pattern formed in the stock `COALINDIA`.

## Usage
<ul>
  <li>Clone the repository and then execute the 'flask run' command on terminal in the project directory.</li>
  <li>The project will be accessible on localhost.</li>
  <li>Access the project on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ instead of http://localhost:5000/ after starting the flask server.</li>
</ul>
